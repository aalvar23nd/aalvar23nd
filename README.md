# Hello :)
## Introduction
My name is Andres Alvarez and I am a current senior studying sociology and data science at the University of Notre Dame! Some of my research interests include immigration, race & ethnicity, and stratification. I hope to work on projects that I can utilize some of my new coding skills, especially in terms of visualizations (it's my favorite kind of data to work with and create!)

## Current Projects 
Throughout this semster I will be working on some cool projects!! Currently, I am working on my first streamlit app, Plenty'a Penguins.

## Skills 
### Programming: Python, R
### Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib
### Tools: Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Excel

## Selected Projects
### [Lessons in Supervised Machine Learning Applications](https://github.com/aalvar23nd/Alvarez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/f7feaab7537a9b64500471a328f92847a6306989/MLStrealitApp):
#### Streamlit app to explore the fundamentals of linear regression modeling. Users can upload their own dataet or use the one provided. Users can then train a model , evaluate its performance, and visualize outputs like prediction accuracy, residual distroibution, and variable coefficients. 
### [Lessons in Unsupervised Machine Learning: CLustering Exploration](https://github.com/aalvar23nd/Alvarez-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/078a57982833bce425ce3de2d73cafd6f5835fe9/MLUnsupervisedApp/README.md):

## Goals  
I hope to learn more about models and work with large datasets in python. I also want to build my portfolio with projects I can be proud of and be generally more confident in my coding capabilities!
