# Hello :)
## Introduction
My name is Andres Alvarez and I am a current senior studying sociology and data science at the University of Notre Dame! Some of my research interests include immigration, race & ethnicity, and stratification. I hope to work on projects that I can utilize some of my new coding skills, especially in terms of visualizations (it's my favorite kind of data to work with and create!)

## Current Projects 
Throughout this semster I will be working on some cool projects!! Currently, I am working on my first streamlit app, Plenty'a Penguins.

## Skills 
### Programming: Python, R
### Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib
### Tools: Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Excel

## Selected Projects

Streamlit app that allows users to upload a dataset or use the California Housing dataset to explore linear regression and identify variable coefficients

Streamlit app that lets users explore k-means and hierarchical clustering with PCA isualization, silhouette scores, and the elbow method. 

## Goals  
I hope to learn more about models and work with large datasets in python. I also want to build my portfolio with projects I can be proud of and be generally more confident in my coding capabilities!
